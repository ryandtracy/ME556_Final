Video Descriptions:
1.Rover_In_Motion.MOV:
The rover controlled by a human representing the planned autonomous trajectory control and sensing.

2.Rover_Kinematic_Model.MOV:
The rover tracing a spiral trajectory. The planned trajectory generated a velocity profile that was input into the modelâ€™s Inverse Kinematics.
The Inverse Kinematic function output motor velocities profiles that were input into Forward Kinematics
The video demonstrates that the Forward Kinematics generated the proper trajectory profile.

3.Hardware_to_Software_Interface.MOV:
This video demonstrates wireless communication between the rover, the on-board firmware, and the python controller.
It also demonstrates real-time distance sensing of the ultrasonic sensors.
The python controller was planned to evolve into a real-time, 2-D mapping interface that would look similar to the Rover Kinematic Model GUI.
